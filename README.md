How do I approach designing software? - I typically try to take a creative approach. If I am being taught one way of doing things, I might try to take the base and then ask, how can this be done another way. My first assignment was a complete failure because instead of following along with each bullet point I just tried throwing things at the wall to see what would stick.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? - I think there is design in everyday things, having read Don Norman's book on this I can see that certain things are structured a way for a reason. There are fundemental truths and logic behind some way things are build.

What design process did you follow for your project work? - My project SDLC was extremely short, maybe two sprint's worth of work. I made massive mistakes my first two to three weeks in development but was able to finsih out slightly past code complete with a finished product.


How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? - I think the better question is what tactics should I not repeat.

How do I approach developing programs? - I would say with tenancity. I could have given up and dropped out. I will not be passing this class with an A or an B. But I stuck it out and worked as hard as I could and I got a finished product. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? - I wouldn't say these strategies are new, I think the language is not my usual, and I think the syntax is weird. I think the architecture reads like a console program which I am familiar with. 

How did iteration factor into your development? - Like I said above, struggled the first several weeks, constantly submitting and refactoring.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? - Currently I work as a senior QA automation engineer for 3M. I have about 4 years in the field writing code professionally. This course work is helping me with CS theory and giving me a good reminder that there is always room to grow and it's okay to not know everything the first time. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? - Well I am now well aware of how difficult OpenGL is, and that someone skilled with it should not be taken for granted. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? - I currently do not work on any desktop or web applications using OpenGL. I have not had any programming jobs that have used this technology either. But a quick google search on OpenGL positions and there are tons of them. From defense, to gaming developers to front end web development. There are several positions and industries that OpenGL might be applied so I do not think I will be in the dark about OpenGL and its impact on the tech community much longer in a professional sense. I would imagine at some point in time in my career I will come across it again. I think it is good to be exposed to new technologies or stacks I will never directly use because it broadens my scope of what is going on in the industry.
